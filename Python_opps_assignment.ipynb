        " *  **Inheritance-** Allows classes to inherit properties and functions from other classes. This helps reuse code and develop a hierarchical structure among classes.\n",
        " *  **Polymorphism-** Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This allows code to work with objects without knowing their exact types.\n",
        " * **Encapsulation-** Combines data and methods within a class to protect the data from external interference.\n",
        " * **Abstraction-** Simplifies complex reality by modeling classes on essential properties and behaviors.\n",
        " *  **Constructor-**In Python, a constructor is made with the init() method, and it is automatically called when a new object is created."

        "Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order).\n"
