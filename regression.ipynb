        "Ans = In multiple linear regression, an interaction term is used to capture the combined effect of two or more independent variables on the dependent variable. It allows the model to account for situations where the influence of one predictor depends on the level of another. Without interaction terms, the model assumes that each variable independently affects the outcome in an additive way. By including interaction terms (e.g., X1×X2), the regression can reflect more complex relationships and improve predictive accuracy. A significant interaction term indicates that the effect of one variable changes depending on the value of another. However, adding interaction terms increases model complexity and can make interpretation more challenging, so they should be included based on theory, prior knowledge, or observed data patterns."

        "Ans.= Heteroscedasticity can be identified in residual plots by examining the relationship between residuals and fitted values or an independent variable. In a **Residuals vs. Fitted Values** plot, if the residuals fan out or contract as the fitted values increase (forming a funnel or cone shape), this suggests heteroscedasticity. Ideally, residuals should be randomly scattered around the horizontal axis with constant spread, indicating homoscedasticity. A **Scale-Location plot** (square root of absolute residuals vs. fitted values) can also reveal varying spread, further confirming heteroscedasticity.\n",

        "Addressing heteroscedasticity is crucial because it affects the reliability of statistical inferences. In the presence of heteroscedasticity, **standard errors** of regression coefficients can be biased, leading to **invalid hypothesis tests** and unreliable confidence intervals. This undermines the precision of model predictions. While the coefficient estimates remain unbiased, they are no longer efficient, meaning other estimation methods (like **Generalized Least Squares**) might be more appropriate. Additionally, heteroscedasticity can distort the **R²** value, making the model appear more accurate than it is. Therefore, detecting and addressing heteroscedasticity ensures valid inferences, reliable predictions, and better model fit.

        "\n",
        "1. **Improved Model Interpretation**: When variables are on different scales (e.g., one in thousands, another in fractions), their coefficients may be difficult to compare directly. Scaling puts all predictors on the same scale, making it easier to interpret the relative importance of each variable.\n",

It involves transforming the input data into polynomial features, training the model, making predictions, and visualizing the polynomial fit. You can adjust the degree of the polynomial and evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error."
